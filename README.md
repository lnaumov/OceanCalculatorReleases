# OceanCalculatorReleases
Here you can find releases of OceanCalc for Linux, Windows, and macOS

Dear users! Here you can download OceanCalc for all popular operation systems:

1. MacOS (tested on MacOS Catalina) - inside the MacOS folder;
2. Windows (tested on Windows 10) - inside the Windows folder;
3. Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS) - inside the Linux folder.

# How to run apps:
## Windows app:
Just download it and run it as a usual Windows executable file.
## Linux app:
Program for Linux can be executed from the Linux terminal. Open the terminal, go to the folder stored calculator file, and type *./OceanCalc_v1.0.0*. 
## MacOS app:
Mac application is displayed like a folder here. So you need to download the folder called OceanCalc_v1.0.0.app and execute it on your Mac like a normal MacOS application. On old Macs, execution may take 15-30 seconds.

### Required dependencies:
Because OceanCalc is a web-based application working with the Google Chrome browser, make sure you a the Google Chrome browser installed on your PC. Otherwise, OceanCalc won't run.

I hope OceanCalc will give you a positive experience. If you have any questions and/or suggestions, please, write me an email:
